I am a PhD student at the Crypto Group, Aarhus University, advised by Jesper Buus Nielsen and Ivan Damg{a}rd. My research is mainly focused on building efficient protocols for Secure Multiparty Computation. More specifically, my work is geared towards the domain of Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning, as well as providing efficient implementations for them.

I received my iMTech (BTech + MTech) degree in Information Technology from International Insitute of Information Technology, Bangalore in 2019. As a part of my thesis, I built an efficient framework to perform Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning using Secure Multiparty Computation. I worked under the guidance of Prof. Ashish Choudhury, along with members of the CrIS Lab.
