Since June 2022 I am a cryptography researcher at <a href="https://concordium.com/">Concordium </a>.
Before joining Concordium, starting on June 2019 until May 2022, I was a PhD student in the <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~orlandi/cryptogroup/">Cryptography and Security Group </a> at Aarhus University under the supervision of <a href="https://multipartycomputation.blogspot.com/p/multiparty-computation.html">Jesper Buus Nielsen</a>. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I earned a masters in Computer Science from Sharif University of technology under the guidance of <a href="http://sharif.ir/~shahram.khazaei/home.html">Shahram Khazaei</a>.


My research is mainly focused on privacy-preserving technologies for blockchains, particularly proof systems with desirable properties, such as succinctness and zero knowledge.
