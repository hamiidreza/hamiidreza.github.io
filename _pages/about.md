I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~orlandi/cryptogroup/">Cryptography and Security Group </a> at Aarhus University, and am advised by <a href="https://multipartycomputation.blogspot.com/p/multiparty-computation.html">Jesper Buus Nielsen</a>. My research is mainly focused on the intersection of cryptography and blockchain.
