I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~orlandi/cryptogroup/">Cryptography and Security Group </a> at Aarhus University, and am advised by <a href="https://multipartycomputation.blogspot.com/p/multiparty-computation.html">Jesper Buus Nielsen</a>. My research is mainly focused on privacy-preserving technologies for blockchains, particularly in proof systems with desirable properties, such as succinctness and zero knowledge.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I earned a masters in Computer Science from Sharif University of technology under the guidance of <a href="http://sharif.ir/~shahram.khazaei/home.html">Shahram Khazaei</a>.
